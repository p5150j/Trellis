# Tech Leadership in Nonprofits — 2026 Research Summary

## The Thesis

A new leadership archetype is emerging in 2026: the **Hybrid Leader** — someone who blends deep technical expertise (AI, MLOps) with strategic product ownership. The old nonprofit execution playbook is broken. A new one is needed.

## The Core Framing: Turning Tech into Trust

In the nonprofit world, the value of technology isn't efficiency for its own sake — it's **trust-building** with communities. The mantra is "From Code to Community." A technical roadmap alone isn't enough; **community is the defining strategy**. Tech serves community, not the other way around.

## The Cycle Nonprofits Are Stuck In

Funding → compliance/security → program delivery → back to fundraising — with outdated tech at every stage. Someone needs to stand on the bridge between technical complexity and human/community needs, connecting implementation to trust.

## The Roadmap

A phased 0–36 month technical approach:

- **0–12 months:** Data infrastructure — measure current state and build foundations
- **12–24 months:** Interoperability — standardize data flows and integrations
- **24–36 months:** Outcomes — leverage data for community impact

## The Hard Numbers (2024/2025 → 2026 Targets)

| Metric | Current State | The Gap |
|---|---|---|
| AI Adoption Plans | 90% of nonprofits plan deep AI adoption | Only 37% have formal policies |
| Data Sharing | 43% share data routinely | Goal is 100% statutory/routine exchange (TEFCA/FHIR) |
| AI Tooling | ~66% already using | Target: move to routine use in CRM and reporting |
| Labor | 65% labor shortage crisis | Severe gaps force AI for administrative automation |
| Revenue | 67% from individual giving | Relationship-driven — trust and identity-first engagement |
| Donor Retention | 46% average | Target: increase via personalized AI-driven stewardship |

## The Real Question

> "Is the gap in your world about technology, or is it about **leadership**?"

The answer is leadership. The tech exists. What's missing is someone who can translate it.

## Personal Strategy: Patrick's Pivot Plan

### Why This Works

- 14+ years in startups, $0→$50M ARR, 3 exits, CTO/VP-level engineering leadership
- AI/ML, cloud infrastructure, full-stack — exactly the skillset nonprofits are desperate for but can't articulate
- SaaS/VC background is a differentiator, not a mismatch. Most nonprofit tech leaders come from the nonprofit side and learn tech. Coming from the other direction fills the exact gap.

### Financial Model

- $5K/month covers a comfortable life in Manila
- Fort Collins house (paid off) can rent for ~$2,200/month = $26,400/year
- Only need ~$33,600/year from work to hit target lifestyle
- A $40K remote role = living well with cushion
- A $60K role = banking $26K/year on top

### Target Orgs: Colorado Grassroots (Fort Collins / Denver / Boulder)

Small nonprofits under $5M budget doing direct human services. The ones running on Google Sheets and prayers. 31 orgs identified across three cities, including:

**Fort Collins:**
- Neighbor to Neighbor (N2N) — housing/homelessness prevention
- CASA of Larimer County — child advocacy (was actively hiring Operations Coordinator)
- Vindeket — food rescue, <10 staff
- Alianza NORCO — immigrant empowerment
- Turning Point — youth substance abuse treatment
- Teaching Tree — affordable childcare
- SAVA Center — sexual assault victim advocacy
- Outreach Fort Collins — homeless services coordination
- Food Bank for Larimer County — feeds 50K+ annually

**Denver:**
- Benefits in Action — helps people apply for government benefits (LLM-powered eligibility screening is a slam dunk match)
- Project Worthmore — refugee resettlement
- Colorado Poverty Law Project — legal aid

**Boulder:**
- 8 additional grassroots orgs identified

### Go-To-Market Strategy

1. **Cold email EDs directly** — 3 sentences: who you are, what you can build, can I buy you coffee
2. **Volunteer first** at 2–3 local orgs — show up, fix their database, have a job offer within a month
3. **Google Form for pro bono work** — distribute via LinkedIn and Techstars network
4. **Code for Fort Collins / Code for Denver** — civic tech volunteer groups that partner with small nonprofits
5. **Colorado Nonprofit Association** — networking events + Pro Bono matching program
6. **Techstars network post** — specific ask for board member intros to Colorado grassroots orgs
7. **Start local 6–12 months → make yourself indispensable → rent house → move to Manila remote**

### Warm Outreach (Priority Order)

1. **Sheila Warren** — former VP/General Counsel at TechSoup (1.4M nonprofits served, 230 countries). Worked together at Project Liberty. She knows every nonprofit ED on earth. Email drafted.
2. **Braxton Woodham** — fellow CTO who made the exact same commercial→mission-driven pivot. Peer-to-peer advice + his tech-for-good network. Email drafted.
3. **Frank McCourt** — billionaire behind Project Liberty ($500M). Worked on his team for 3 years. His endorsement carries massive weight even if forwarded to an assistant. Email drafted. (Send after Sheila/Braxton to show momentum.)

### Due Diligence: Vetting Nonprofits

The nonprofit equivalent of Crunchbase/Carta:

- **ProPublica Nonprofit Explorer** (projects.propublica.org/nonprofits) — every org's IRS Form 990, public financials going back years
- **GuideStar / Candid** (candid.org) — transparency seals (Bronze→Platinum), financial info, impact metrics
- **Charity Navigator** (charitynavigator.org) — financial health ratings, 4 stars = solid

**Red flags on a 990:**
- Revenue dropped 2+ years in a row
- One funder is >50% of revenue
- Less than 3 months cash on hand
- No audited financials (orgs over $750K should have an audit)
- High ED turnover (check LinkedIn)

**Pro move:** Pull the 990 before emailing any ED. Walk in knowing their budget better than they expect.

### Job Search Boards (Search "operations" or "systems", not "technology")

- Idealist.org
- TechJobsForGood.com
- NTEN Job Board (nten.org/jobs)
- WorkForGood.org
- Colorado Nonprofit Association (coloradononprofits.org/careers)
- Utah Nonprofits Association job board
- Wyoming Nonprofit Network job board
- AZ Impact for Good (azimpactforgood.org)
- ASU Lodestar Center (lodestar.asu.edu/nonprofit-jobs)

### Key Insight

> Don't apply for "technology" roles. Apply for Operations Director, Program Director, or even Executive Director at tiny orgs ($500K–$2M budget). You'll end up being their tech person anyway, plus you'll actually run things.
