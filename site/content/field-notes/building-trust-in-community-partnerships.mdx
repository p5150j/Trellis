Trust is the foundation of effective community partnerships. Without it, even the best-intentioned initiatives can fall short of their potential. Over the past year, we've had the privilege of working with several community organizations, and we've learned valuable lessons about what it takes to build and maintain trust.

## Starting with Listening

The most important step in building trust is often the simplest: listening. Before we propose solutions or share our expertise, we spend time understanding the community's history, challenges, and aspirations.

This means:

- **Attending community meetings** as observers, not experts
- **Asking open-ended questions** that invite storytelling
- **Acknowledging past harms** from well-meaning outside organizations

## Consistency Over Time

Trust isn't built in a single meeting or workshop. It develops through consistent presence and follow-through. When we say we'll do something, we do it. When we make a mistake, we acknowledge it openly.

## Sharing Power

Perhaps the most difficult but important aspect of trust-building is sharing power. This means:

1. Co-designing research questions with community members
2. Sharing data and findings openly and accessibly
3. Supporting community-led initiatives, even when they differ from our recommendations

## Looking Forward

As we continue our work, we're committed to deepening our understanding of trust-building practices. We know we won't always get it right, but we're dedicated to learning and improving alongside the communities we serve.
