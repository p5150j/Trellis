## The Engine Behind Trellis

The Trellis Platform is the internal research and scoring engine that powers everything we do. It scrapes data from IRS filings, Airtable databases, and the open web, then enriches each organization profile with AI-generated insights. The result is a quantitative fit score across six dimensions that tells us exactly where our engineering time will have the most impact.

## Why We Built This

Before Trellis, finding the right nonprofit partners meant manual research, spreadsheet tracking, and gut-feel decisions. We knew there had to be a better way to match engineering talent with mission-driven organizations. The platform automates the entire pipeline from discovery to scoring, replacing intuition with data.

## Scoring Methodology

Our scoring engine evaluates every nonprofit across six dimensions, each weighted to reflect what makes a successful engineering partnership. The dimensions are designed to identify organizations where a small amount of technical work can unlock outsized impact.

- **AI/ML Fit** — How well does the org's mission align with AI/ML solutions?
- **Tech Gap** — How underserved is the org from a technology standpoint?
- **Impact Potential** — What's the scale of impact if we build the right thing?
- **Org Size** — Is the org large enough to sustain a technical partnership?
- **Financial Viability** — Does the org have stable funding to support implementation?
- **Growth Trajectory** — Is the org growing in a way that amplifies our contribution?

Each dimension is scored 1–5, then combined into a weighted composite score out of 100. The top 20 proposals represent the highest-fit opportunities across our entire research pipeline.

## What's Next

The web platform is the final piece — a public-facing site where nonprofits can explore their scores, see where they stand, and understand what a partnership with arus would look like. We're also expanding the scraping pipeline to cover international nonprofits and additional data sources.
