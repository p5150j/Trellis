Community resilience—the ability of a community to withstand, adapt to, and recover from adversity—has become a central focus of community development work. This paper presents a framework for understanding and measuring resilience that we've developed through extensive literature review and field research.

## Defining Resilience

Resilience is often discussed but rarely defined with precision. We propose a definition that encompasses three key dimensions:

1. **Absorptive Capacity**: The ability to minimize exposure to shocks and stresses
2. **Adaptive Capacity**: The ability to make incremental adjustments in response to changing conditions
3. **Transformative Capacity**: The ability to make fundamental changes to underlying systems and structures

## Key Indicators

Our framework identifies indicators across multiple domains:

### Social Capital

- Network density and diversity
- Trust among community members
- Civic participation rates
- Presence of bridging organizations

### Economic Diversity

- Employment sector distribution
- Local business ownership
- Access to financial services
- Income inequality measures

### Institutional Strength

- Government effectiveness
- Access to public services
- Presence of nonprofit organizations
- Emergency preparedness systems

## Measurement Approach

We recommend a mixed-methods approach that combines:

- **Quantitative surveys** to establish baseline measures
- **Qualitative interviews** to understand local context
- **Participatory mapping** to identify assets and vulnerabilities
- **Longitudinal tracking** to measure change over time

## Limitations and Future Research

This framework is a starting point, not a definitive model. We recognize that:

- Context matters enormously—indicators relevant in one community may not apply elsewhere
- Communities should be involved in defining what resilience means to them
- Measurement can never fully capture the complexity of community life

We continue to refine this framework through ongoing research and community feedback.

## Conclusion

Building community resilience requires understanding where communities are strong and where they face challenges. We hope this framework provides a useful starting point for communities and organizations seeking to strengthen their capacity to thrive in the face of adversity.
