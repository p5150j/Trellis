# Trellis

**The integration layer for small-to-mid nonprofits.**

Trellis connects the disconnected systems that nonprofit teams wrestle with daily — CRMs, accounting software, grant trackers, volunteer databases — so staff can spend less time on data entry and more time on mission.

---

## The Problem

Small-to-mid nonprofits ($500K–$5M budget) operate with 5–10 disconnected tools. Staff become the integration layer, manually copying data between systems, assembling reports from multiple sources, and maintaining personal spreadsheets to track what their software can't.

The result: **43% more time spent on admin** compared to organizations with integrated systems.

## The Solution

Trellis provides the connective tissue between existing tools — not replacing them, but making them work together. A unified data model and API integrations create automated pipelines that:

- Sync donations from payment processors to CRM to accounting in real-time
- Auto-generate grant reports from connected program and financial data
- Track volunteer hours and feed them into grant match calculations
- Build board packets from live data instead of stale exports

## Status

Early stage. Currently in research and design.

*Less admin. More mission.*
