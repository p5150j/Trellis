Recent Funding (Specific Grants, Amounts, Funders)\nNo specific grants, amounts, or funders are directly listed for OCF itself in available data from 2023-2025. OCF's revenue primarily came from contributions: $27.4M (99.7% of total) in one year, $8.8M (94.3%) in another, $4.7M (97.2%) in another, and $304K (95.2%) in an earlier period, with program services as a minor source.[7] Platform updates mention unrelated grants like Kolibri Foundation $100,000 and Michael Reese Health Trust $100,000, but these appear tied to hosted collectives, not OCF directly.[1] Ballmer Group granted to \"the Collective\" for BIPOC capacity-building ($ amount unspecified in snippet, separate from Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's $1.89M over 2023-2025).[2]\n\n### 2. Major Funders/Donors\nUnknown; no specific major funders or donors named for OCF. Revenue was overwhelmingly from contributions, but individual or organizational names are not detailed in sources.[7] Related platforms like Open Source Collective (OSC, a separate 501(c)(6)) received funds from Microsoft ($500K to Open Web Docs), GitHub Sponsors (over $1M in 2024), Google (Season of Docs/Summer of Code), and Sentry ($75K).[3]\n\n### 3. Approximate Number of Employees/Staff\nUnknown; no employee or staff count provided. OCF takes 8% of donations (dropping to 6% over $500K raised) to pay its team and build technology.[5] OSC expenses include $322K to 42 contractors, but this is not OCF.[6]\n\n### 4. Recent News or Impact Work (2023-2025)\n- **Dissolution**: Ceased fiscal sponsorship September 30, 2024; dissolving December 31, 2024; all collectives frozen October 1, 2024, with 2023 expenses due by January 15, 2024.[4][8][9]\n- **Hosted Collectives' Impacts (via OCF)**: Social Health Labs awarded $1,000 micro-grant; South Philadelphia Community Fridge raised ~$4,000 for food/outreach; one collective grew to 534 general volunteers and 443 reference volunteers, receiving $7,391 in 2023 donations; another resourced 125+ Black single mothers, redistributed $135K from 345 partners (on track for +$70K in holidays).[1][4]\n- OCF enabled 300+ groups to raise/spend $13M/year transparently before closure.[5] This does not impact the broader Open Collective platform.[9] OSC (related) hit $50M total contributions by January 2025, paid out $9.7M to maintainers in 2024 (up 20%), received ~$12.5M contributions.[3]",
