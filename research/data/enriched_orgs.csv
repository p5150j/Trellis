Microsoft has committed to supporting the Partnership for Global Inclusivity on AI (a related initiative) by investing more than **$12 billion in AI** during 2024 and 2025, though this appears to be a broader corporate commitment rather than direct funding to PAI itself.[8]

Partnership on AI has outlined three key priorities for 2025:[5]

1. **Understanding agentic AI:** With seed funding from CSET at Georgetown University, PAI is working with technologists, researchers, civil society, and academic experts to monitor the impacts of AI assistants and identify potential risks and harms of agentic AI systems.

2. **Supporting assurance and accountability ecosystems:** PAI is defining elements of a robust AI assurance ecosystem and is building on its previous work on safe foundational model deployment.

3. **Global expansion:** PAI is reaching out to new partners and regions globally, positioning the AI Action Summit as an opportunity to accelerate international dialogue on AI developed in the public interest.

Additionally, Partnership on AI recommended specific updates to the 2025 National AI R&D Strategic Plan, emphasizing support for NSF-led National AI Research Institutes, implementation of the National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR) Pilot, and expansion of industry-university partnerships.[3] PAI's work spans five program areas: Safety Critical AI, Fair, Transparent, and Accountable AI, AI Labor and the Economy, Inclusive Research and Design, and AI and Media Integrity.[2]",Partnership on AI launched new case studies in 2024 and is set to release a 2025 report on AI's impact on nonprofits.
